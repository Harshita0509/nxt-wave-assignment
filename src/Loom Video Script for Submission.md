# Loom Video Script for Submission

1. Introduction

---

Hi, my name is [Your Name].
This is my submission for the NxtWave React List Creation Assignment.

2. App Overview

---

This app lets you view two lists of animals, select them, and rearrange their items using a temporary "new list" in between.

3. Main Features Demo

---

a. Loading and Error Handling

- When the app loads, it fetches data from an API.
- If the data is loading, you'll see a spinner.
- If there's a network or server error, you'll see an error message and a "Try Again" button.

b. Viewing Lists

- Here you can see List 1 and List 2, each with their own items.
- The lists are scrollable if there are many items.

c. Selecting Lists

- You can select the lists using these checkboxes.
- You must select exactly two lists to create a new list.
- If you try to create a new list without selecting two, you'll see an error message.

d. Creating a New List

- When you select two lists and click "Create a new list", you enter the List Creation view.
- Here, you see the two selected lists and a new empty list in the middle.

e. Moving Items

- You can move items between the lists using the arrow buttons.
- For example, I'll move an item from List 1 to the new list, and from the new list to List 2.

f. Cancel and Update

- If you click "Cancel", all changes are discarded and you go back to the main view.
- If you click "Update", the changes are saved and you return to the main view with the updated lists.

g. Responsiveness

- The app is fully responsive.
- If I resize the window or use a mobile device, the lists stack vertically and everything remains usable.

4. Code Structure (Optional)

---

- The code is organized into reusable components.
- I've handled API loading, error states, and all the required UI logic using React hooks and clean state management.

5. Conclusion

---

That's my submission!
Thank you for reviewing my project.

## Tips:

- Keep your video under 5 minutes.
- Speak slowly and clearly.
- Show each feature as you talk about it.
- If you make a mistake, just pause and continueâ€”no need to be perfect!
